# Helping with TOCropViewController

The issue is, on pod install
[Xcodeproj] Generated duplicate UUIDs

Things learned:
* pbxproj probably stands for 'project build' 'xcode proj', never thought about that before
* it uses UUIDs for each file
* you can specify a specific commit in cocoapods
* you can point cocoapods at a local path
* `pod spec lint` is the MVP is sussing out issues
* /**/ gives you subfiles/folders recursively
* Git Fork.app is great at squashing commits together to clean up my mess
* you can tell your cocoa podspec to ignore some sources
* dealing with the navigation controller going back in the coordinator pattern looks like a pain
